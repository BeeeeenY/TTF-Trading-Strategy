# TTF Price Forecasting and Spread Trading Strategy
Machine Learning Enhanced Trading Strategies for TTF (Title Transfer Facility) Natural Gas Markets

## Overview

This repository consists of two main components:

1. **`ML_price_regression.ipynb`**  
   This notebook performs machine learning-based forecasting for the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) natural gas front-month price using both LSTM and XGBoost regression models. It also includes exploratory analysis using correlation and cointegration tests between TTF and key related variables (Brent crude and Carbon prices).

2. **`SpreadTrade.ipynb`**  
   This notebook implements a spread trading strategy that leverages the predictions generated from the ML model. It builds on top of the forecasted price data to construct and evaluate a spread trading portfolio.

## Folder Structure

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ ML_price_regression.ipynb             # ML model training and forecast (LSTM & XGBoost)
â”œâ”€â”€ SpreadTrade.ipynb                 # Spread trading strategy using forecasted data
â”œâ”€â”€ master_noNA.xlsx                      # Original cleaned dataset (input to ML notebook)
â”œâ”€â”€ master_with_lstm_and_xgb_preds.xlsx   # Output from ML notebook, used in trading notebook
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                             # Project documentation
```
